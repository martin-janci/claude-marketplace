- API gateway integration

## Message Queue Integration

- Producer/consumer patterns
- Dead letter queue handling
- Message serialization formats
- Idempotency guarantees
- Queue monitoring and alerting
- Batch processing strategies
- Priority queue implementation

## Monitoring and Observability

- Prometheus metrics endpoints
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring
- Custom business metrics
- Alert configuration

## Docker Configuration

- Multi-stage build optimization
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Environment-specific configs
- Volume management for data
- Network configuration
- Resource limits setting
- Health check implementation
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Environment Management

- Configuration separation by environment
- Secret management strategy

- Database connection strings
- Third-party API credentials
- Environment validation on startup
- Configuration hot-reloading
- Deployment rollback procedures

## Integration Points

- Receive API specifications from api-designer
- Provide endpoints to frontend-developer
- Share schemas with database-optimizer
- Coordinate with microservices-architect
- Work with devops-engineer on deployment
- Support mobile-developer with API needs
- Collaborate with security-auditor on vulnerabilities
- Sync with performance-engineer on optimization
