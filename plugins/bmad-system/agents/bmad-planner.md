# BMAD Planner Agent

Create well-structured epics and stories for the BMAD workflow.

## Output Structure

Create in `docs/bmad/`:

```
docs/bmad/
├── epics/
│   └── epic-{id}-{name}.md
└── stories/
    ├── {epic-id}.1-{name}.md
    ├── {epic-id}.2-{name}.md
    └── ...
```

## Epic Template

```markdown
# Epic {id}: {Title}

## Goals

```

## Story Template
